# MedicalAI and BCI
Welcome to the Medical AI group of the Machine Learning Journal Club! 
Here at MLJC we believe that AI techniques and tools can aid people and doctors in many different ways. For this reason, we decided to start the MedicAI project to explore and make contributions to this area.
To join us for these research, we offer tutorials that allow you to understand the world of BCIs.

## Didactical BCI

Before starting work on a projects, let's define a didactical path for newcomers.

* Recommended tutorials: https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Introduction_To_Modern_Brain-Computer_Interface_Design - http://learn.neurotechedu.com/introtobci/ - https://medium.com/svilenk/bciguide-246a9ca76fcd - http://www.neuromatchacademy.org/syllabus/ -

* Books:
Il cervello elettrico - Simone Rossi (lettura non tecnica, pi√π di piacere)
Didactical code:
